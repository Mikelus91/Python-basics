Optimized Reward Function (Example)

This file contains an example of a reward function used during the final stages of my AWS DeepRacer experimentation.

It is not necessarily the exact version used in the final winning model, but it accurately represents the design approach, logic, and optimization criteria I applied throughout the competition.

The function focuses on balancing speed, stability, and trajectory optimization by adapting rewards dynamically based on steering angle, speed, and track geometry.
